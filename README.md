# Kaggle-Problem

**Aim:** The objecctive of this project is to predict the sales of a given test set using a Deep Neural Network Architecture.


**Project Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales


**Dataset Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data

**Note:** This project can be solved using machine learning algorithm but as a part of my assignment, I am supposed to use either CNN or Deep Neural Network Architecture like LSTM, AutoEncoders etc.
